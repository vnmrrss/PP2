#correct:
if 42 > 41:
  print("Fourty two is greater than fourty one")
#incorrect:
if 42 > 41:
print("Five is greater than two!")
#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
#Variables:
x = 42
y = "Sentence"
