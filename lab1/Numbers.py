"""
There are three numeric types in Python:
int, float, complex.
"""
#Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex
#To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))


#Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length:
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))


#Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals:
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))
#Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
print(type(x), type(y))


#Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j
print(type(x), type(y), type(z))


#You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:
c = 42.42
d = int(c)
print(d, type(d)) #Output: 42, int


#Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 43))
#random num from 1-42
